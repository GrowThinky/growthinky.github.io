       I'm a Computer Science
       student at Philipps University Marburg. I'm currently looking
       for jobs as a software engineer around the EU.

         As a programmer, I now feel confident that I can teach myself anything - all I need is a cup of coffee, my laptop and a good playlist
         (make it 90s pop and maybe some japanese speed-metal and noise-rock).
         My greatest strength is my passion for learning and my persistence in overcoming challenges.
         What I am looking for is an inspiring team of developers that is willing to give me responsibilites to push my abilies further and enable me to learn the industry-skills I need for my developer journey.

         I spent the last 4 years immersed in the joy of computer science and math. But, I also feel connected to the humanities and the arts. Before I entered CS, I completed a Bachelor of Arts in social sciences and wrote my thesis on the topic of technology use for social services.
         If you read this far, you must really be interested in me! In that case: Let's connect!

       <h1>Eclipse IDE Plugin</h1>
       <p>
       <p>
       As part of my thesis I am currently developing a plugin for Eclipse which will make it easier to work with @Annotations.

       <h1>Android App </h1>
         <!--<img src="app.png" alt="android app"> -->

       <p>During my Software internship I developed an Andorid app for students of my university. Functionalities are: Accessing information about classes, meal plans and rooms as well as a navigation and calendar features. The app accesses information via the universitie's own SOAP API. It supports english and german languages.

       <h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
       <!--<img src="data.png" alt="datapoint visualizations"> -->
       <p><!--Social media platforms are playing an increasing role in the spread of information and opinion formation on socio-political topics. This is especially relevant for polarizing topics, with highly factionalized chat groups forming around shared narratives and often proliferating misinformation (Cinelli eta al 2021). These groups can serve as echo-chambers with the effect of further escalating political polarization of their users, resulting in increasingly extreme views.
           <br> <br> -->
       During my internship at CAISA lab, I built a machine learning model that predicts political extremity in reddit posts.
       Drawing from my background in social science and pschology, I hand-selected a small number of variables measuring psycholinguistic features that correlate with political extremity. That way I achived performance slightly better than a deep learning model using Google's Bert.
